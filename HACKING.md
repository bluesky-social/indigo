## git repo contents

Commands (run with, eg, `go run ./cmd/bigsky`):

- `cmd/bigsky`: BGS+indexer daemon
- `cmd/gosky`: client CLI for talking to a PDS
- `cmd/lexgen`: codegen tool for lexicons (Lexicon JSON to golang package)
- `cmd/pds`: PDS daemon
- `cmd/stress`: connects to local/default PDS and creates a ton of random posts
- `cmd/beemo`: slack bot for moderation reporting (Bluesky Moderation Observer)
- `gen`: dev tool to run CBOR type codegen

Packages:

- `api`: mostly output of lexgen (codegen) for lexicons: structs, CBOR marshaling. some higher-level code, and a PLC client (may rename)
- `bgs`: server implementation for crawling, etc
- `carstore`: library for storing repo data in CAR files on disk, plus a metadata SQL db
- `events`: types, codegen CBOR helpers, and persistence for event feeds
- `indexer`: aggregator, handling like counts etc in SQL database
- `key`: did:key crypto helpers (serialization, signing) (may rename or spin out)
- `lex`: implements codegen for Lexicons (!)
- `mst`: merkle search tree implementation
- `notifs`: helpers for notification objects (hydration, etc)
- `plc`: implementation of a *fake* PLC server (not persisted), and a PLC client
- `repo`: implements atproto repo on top of a blockstore. CBOR types
- `repomgr`: wraps many repos with a single carstore backend. handles events, locking
- `pds`: PDS server implementation
- `testing`: integration tests; testing helpers
- `models`: database types/models/schemas; shared in several places
- `util`: a few common definitions (may rename)
- `xrpc`: XRPC client (not server) helpers

Other:

- `testscripts`: shell scripts that run gosky (CLI client) against local PDS


## jargon

- BGS: Big Graph Service (or Server), which centrals crawls/consumes content from "all" PDSs and re-broadcasts as a firehose
- PDS: Personal Data Server (or Service), which stores user atproto repositories and acts as a user agent in the network
- CLI: Command Line Tool
- CBOR: a binary serialization format, smilar to JSON
- PLC: "placeholder" DID provider
- DID: Decentralized IDentifier, a flexible W3C specification for persistent identifiers in URI form (eg, "did:plc:abcd1234")
- XRPC: atproto convention for HTTP GET and POST endpoints specified by namespaced Lexicon schemas
- CAR: simple file format for storing binary content-addressed blocks/blobs, sort of like .tar files
- CID: content identifier for binary blobs, basically a flexible encoding of hash values
- MST: Merkle Search Tree, a key/value map data structure using content addressed nodes


## lexicon and CBOR marshaling code generation

`gen/main.go` has a list of types internal to packages in this repo which need CBOR helper codegen. If you edit those types, or update the listed types/packages, re-run codegen like:

    # make sure everything can build cleanly first
    make build

    # then generate
    go run ./gen

To run codegen for new or updated Lexicons, using lexgen, first place (or git
checout) the JSON lexicon files `$SOMEWHERE`. Also, install the `goimports`
tool. Then, in *this* repository (indigo), run commands like:

    go run ./cmd/lexgen/ --package bsky --prefix app.bsky --outdir api/bsky $SOMEWHERE/lexicons/app/bsky/
    go run ./cmd/lexgen/ --package atproto --prefix com.atproto --outdir api/atproto $SOMEWHERE/lexicons/com/atproto/

You may want to delete all the codegen files before re-generating, to detect deleted files.

It can require some manual munging between the lexgen step and a later `go run ./gen` to make sure things compile at least temporarily; otherwise the `gen` will not run.

To generate server stubs and handlers, push them in a temporary directory
first, then merge changes in to the actual PDS code:

    go run ./cmd/lexgen/ --package pds --gen-server --types-import com.atproto:github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/api/atproto --types-import app.bsky:github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/api/bsky --outdir pds $SOMEWHERE/lexicons

    mkdir tmppds
    go run ./cmd/lexgen/ --package pds --gen-server --types-import com.atproto:github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/api/atproto --types-import app.bsky:github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/api/bsky --outdir tmppds --gen-handlers $SOMEWHERE/lexicons


## tips and tricks

When debugging websocat streams, the `websocat` tool (rust) can be helpful. CBOR binary is sort of mangled in to text by default. Eg:

    # consume repo events from PDS
    websocat ws://localhost:4989/events

    # consume repo events from BGS
    websocat ws://localhost:2470/events

Send the BGS a ding-dong:

    # tell BGS to consume from PDS
    http --json post localhost:2470/add-target host="localhost:4989"

Set the log level to be more verbose, using an env variable:

    GOLOG_LOG_LEVEL=info go run ./cmd/pds


## gosky basic usage

Running against local typescript PDS in `dev-env` mode:

	# as "alice" user
	go run ./cmd/gosky/ --pds http://localhost:2583 createSession alice.test hunter2 > bsky.auth

The `bsky.auth` file is the default place that `gosky` and other client
commands will look for auth info.


## slack report bot basic usage

You need an admin token, slack webhook URL, and auth file (see gosky above).
The auth file isn't actually used, only the admin token.

    # configure a slack webhook
    export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/T028K87/B04NBDB/oWbsHasdf23r2d

    # example pulling admin token out of `pass` password manager
    export BSKY_ADMIN_AUTH=`pass bsky/pds-admin-staging | head -n1`

    # example just setting admin token directly
    export BSKY_ADMIN_AUTH="someinsecurething123"

    # run the bot
    GOLOG_LOG_LEVEL=debug go run ./cmd/beemo/ --pds https://pds.staging.example.com --auth bsky.auth notify-reports
