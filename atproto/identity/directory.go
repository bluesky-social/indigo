// Ergonomic interface for atproto identity lookup, by DID or handle.
//
// The "Lookup" methods resolve identities (handle and DID), and return results in a compact, opinionated struct (`Identity`). They do bi-directional handle/DID verification by default. Clients and services should use these methods by default, instead of resolving handles or DIDs separately.
//
// Looking up a handle which fails to resolve, or don't match DID alsoKnownAs, returns an error. When looking up a DID, if the handle does not resolve back to the DID, the lookup succeeds and returns an `Identity` where the Handle is the special `handle.invalid` value.
//
// Some example implementations of this interface could be:
//   - basic direct resolution on every call
//   - local in-memory caching layer to reduce network hits
//   - API client, which just makes requests to PDS (or other remote service)
//   - client for shared network cache (eg, Redis)
