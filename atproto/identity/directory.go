// API for doing account lookups by DID or handle, with bi-directional verification handled automatically. Almost all atproto services and clients should use an implementation of this interface instead of resolving handles or DIDs separately
//
// Handles which fail to resolve, or don't match DID alsoKnownAs, are an error. DIDs which resolve but the handle does not resolve back to the DID return an Identity where the Handle is the special `handle.invalid` value.
//
// Some example implementations of this interface could be:
//   - basic direct resolution on every call
//   - local in-memory caching layer to reduce network hits
//   - API client, which just makes requests to PDS (or other remote service)
//   - client for shared network cache (eg, Redis)
