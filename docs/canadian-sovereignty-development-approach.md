# Canadian Data Sovereignty Development Approach for Gander Social

## Understanding My Initial Misunderstanding (An Important Learning Moment)

When you first asked about the missing `docker/development.yml` file, I made a significant error in my approach. I created an overly complex Docker Compose setup without properly understanding how Gander actually develops their AT Protocol services. This is an excellent teaching moment about the importance of understanding existing systems before attempting to extend them.

Gander's development philosophy prioritizes simplicity and fast iteration. Rather than running everything in containers, they use Go's excellent tooling to compile and run services directly on your development machine. This approach provides several advantages that are particularly important for your Canadian sovereignty work:

**Fast Development Iteration:** When you modify relay code for Canadian features, you can rebuild and restart the service in seconds rather than minutes. This becomes crucial when you're implementing complex sovereignty logic that requires frequent testing and refinement.

**Clear Debugging:** Running services directly allows you to use Go's excellent debugging tools, set breakpoints, and examine memory state. This is essential when you're implementing encryption and audit features where correctness is critical.

**Resource Efficiency:** Your development machine's resources aren't consumed by multiple container layers, leaving more capacity for the actual AT Protocol services you're modifying.

## The Proper Gander Development Workflow

Let me walk you through how Gander development actually works, building from simple concepts to the complete workflow you'll need for your Canadian sovereignty implementation.

### Foundation Layer: Understanding the Makefile

The `Makefile` in your repository is the central orchestrator for development activities. Think of it as a recipe book that contains all the common development tasks in standardized, repeatable forms. Let's examine the key targets you'll use regularly:

When you run `make build`, the system compiles all the AT Protocol services into executable binaries. This includes the relay service you'll be modifying for Canadian sovereignty, the various CLI tools, and support utilities. The build process is fast because Go compiles to native machine code and has excellent dependency management.

The `make run-dev-relay` target is particularly important for your work. This compiles and runs the relay service with development-friendly defaults. It uses SQLite databases stored in `./data/relay/` directory, which provides excellent performance for development while requiring no external database setup.

When you need PostgreSQL for testing database-specific features or performance characteristics, `make run-postgres` starts a containerized PostgreSQL instance using the configuration in `cmd/bigsky/docker-compose.yml`. This gives you production-like database behavior when you need it, without the overhead of running it constantly during development.

### Service Architecture: Understanding What You're Extending

The AT Protocol implements a federated social network through several key services, each with distinct responsibilities. Understanding these responsibilities is crucial for implementing Canadian sovereignty features correctly.

**The Relay Service (BigSky):** This is the service you'll primarily be modifying. The relay aggregates data from multiple Personal Data Servers and provides the "firehose" - a real-time stream of all public activity in the network. For Canadian sovereignty, you'll be creating a parallel Canadian relay that only includes data from Canadian users who have explicitly opted into the Canadian network.

**Personal Data Servers (PDS):** These store individual users' data and serve as their representatives in the network. For your Canadian sovereignty implementation, you'll need to identify Canadian PDSs and ensure they can securely communicate with your Canadian relay while maintaining encryption requirements.

**Identity Resolution (PLC Directory):** This service maps decentralized identifiers to actual data locations. Your Canadian implementation will use the same global PLC directory but will route Canadian users to Canadian-specific services.

### Development Environment Setup: Building Your Foundation

Let's establish your development environment step by step, building on Gander's existing patterns while adding Canadian sovereignty capabilities.

First, ensure you have the proper Go development environment. Gander uses the latest stable Go version, which provides excellent performance and the most recent language features. The `GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar` setting in the Makefile enables improved loop variable semantics that prevent common programming errors.

Copy the example environment configuration to create your local settings:

```bash
cp example.dev.env .env
```

This `.env` file contains the basic AT Protocol service URLs and authentication credentials. You'll extend this with Canadian sovereignty configuration as we progress through the implementation.

The minimal infrastructure services I've provided in `docker/development.yml` support your Canadian sovereignty requirements without overwhelming your development environment. PostgreSQL provides production-like database testing, Redis enables session management and geographic caching, IPFS supports content-addressed storage with Canadian pinning capabilities, and the mock HSM simulates secure key management for development.

## Canadian Sovereignty Implementation Strategy

Now that you understand the foundation, let's build up your Canadian sovereignty implementation systematically. Your requirements involve three main components that work together to create a compliant, secure Canadian social network.

### Dual Firehose Architecture: Serving Two Networks Simultaneously

The concept of a dual firehose means your implementation serves both the global AT Protocol network and a Canadian-specific network simultaneously. Think of this as running two parallel social networks that share identity infrastructure but maintain separate data flows.

Your global firehose operates exactly like the standard Gander relay, aggregating data from all participating PDSs worldwide. This maintains compatibility with existing AT Protocol clients and services, ensuring Canadian users can still participate in the broader decentralized social web when they choose to.

The Canadian firehose operates under different rules. It only includes data from users who have explicitly opted into the Canadian network and meet specific criteria. This might include Canadian citizens, Canadian residents, or users who have specifically requested Canadian data protection. The Canadian firehose also applies additional encryption and audit logging to meet Canadian privacy law requirements.

The technical implementation involves modifying the relay service to maintain two separate data streams. When the relay receives data from a PDS, it first determines whether that data should be included in the Canadian firehose based on user preferences and jurisdiction rules. Canadian-eligible data gets processed through additional encryption and compliance logging before being added to the Canadian stream.

### Private PDS Messaging: End-to-End Encryption with Canadian Key Management

Your private PDS messaging requirement addresses a significant limitation in the current AT Protocol specification. While the protocol supports private posts, it doesn't provide strong guarantees about encryption or key management. For Canadian sovereignty, you need cryptographic assurance that private messages remain private and that encryption keys are managed within Canadian jurisdiction.

The technical approach involves extending PDS services to support end-to-end encryption for private messages. When a Canadian user sends a private message, their PDS encrypts the message using keys managed by Canadian HSM infrastructure. The encrypted message is then stored and transmitted through the AT Protocol infrastructure, but only authorized recipients with appropriate decryption keys can read the content.

Key management becomes crucial here. Your HSM integration ensures that encryption keys are generated, stored, and managed within Canadian jurisdiction according to Canadian security standards. Even if foreign services can access the encrypted messages, they cannot decrypt them without access to the Canadian-controlled key management infrastructure.

### Compliance and Audit Framework: Meeting Canadian Legal Requirements

Canadian privacy laws, particularly PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), require specific safeguards around personal data collection, use, and disclosure. Your implementation needs to track all data operations to demonstrate compliance and provide audit trails when required.

The compliance framework operates by logging every significant data operation that involves Canadian users. When the Canadian relay processes data, when PDSs handle private messages, or when users access their information, these operations are recorded with sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with Canadian privacy law.

The audit trail includes not just what happened, but why it happened, who authorized it, and what legal basis permitted the operation. This level of detail enables you to respond to privacy requests, government inquiries, and compliance audits with comprehensive documentation of your data handling practices.

## Implementation Roadmap: Step-by-Step Development

Let me provide you with a concrete roadmap for implementing these features, building from foundational changes to complete Canadian sovereignty capabilities.

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation (Week 1-2)

Begin by establishing your development environment using the proper Gander workflow with Canadian sovereignty extensions. Start your infrastructure services using the minimal Docker Compose setup I've provided, then use the Makefile targets to run AT Protocol services directly.

Modify the relay service to support dual data streams. Start with a simple flag that determines whether data should be included in a "Canadian" stream, without implementing the full sovereignty logic yet. This gives you a foundation to build upon while maintaining compatibility with existing functionality.

Create database extensions for Canadian compliance logging. The SQL initialization script I've provided establishes the basic audit infrastructure, but you'll need to integrate it with the relay service to actually capture compliance events.

### Phase 2: User Classification and Routing (Week 3-4)

Implement the logic for determining which users should be included in the Canadian firehose. This involves examining user profiles, PDS locations, and explicit user preferences to classify users as eligible for the Canadian network.

Create configuration mechanisms that allow Canadian PDSs to register with your Canadian relay. This registration process should include compliance verification, ensuring that Canadian PDSs meet the necessary security and audit requirements for handling Canadian user data.

Extend the firehose endpoint to serve different data streams based on client requests. Clients requesting the Canadian firehose should receive only Canadian-eligible data, while global clients receive the standard global stream.

### Phase 3: Encryption and Key Management Integration (Week 5-6)

Integrate HSM capabilities for Canadian key management. Start with the mock HSM for development, but design the integration to support real HSM hardware or cloud HSM services in production.

Extend PDS services to support end-to-end encryption for private messages. This involves modifying message storage and retrieval logic to encrypt/decrypt data using HSM-managed keys.

Implement key rotation and management procedures that maintain security while ensuring message accessibility for authorized users.

### Phase 4: Compliance and Audit Implementation (Week 7-8)

Complete the compliance logging system by integrating audit trail creation throughout your Canadian sovereignty services. Every data operation should generate appropriate audit records that demonstrate compliance with Canadian privacy law.

Create compliance reporting tools that can generate the reports and documentation required for regulatory compliance. These tools should aggregate audit data into meaningful compliance metrics and violation reports.

Implement privacy request handling that allows Canadian users to access, correct, or delete their personal information as required by Canadian privacy law.

### Phase 5: Integration Testing and Optimization (Week 9-10)

Test your Canadian sovereignty implementation against real-world scenarios, including cross-border data access, privacy requests, and compliance audits.

Optimize performance to ensure that Canadian sovereignty features don't significantly impact system performance or user experience.

Validate that your implementation correctly handles edge cases, such as users changing jurisdiction or revoking consent for Canadian data processing.

## Working with ThinkOn Infrastructure

Since ThinkOn is providing your hosting and relay infrastructure, you'll need to adapt your development environment to work with their production systems. This involves several considerations that bridge development and production environments.

**Network Integration:** Your development environment should mirror ThinkOn's network architecture as closely as possible. This includes understanding their Canadian data center locations, network security requirements, and interconnection with global AT Protocol services.

**Compliance Mapping:** ThinkOn's existing compliance certifications and security practices should be integrated into your compliance framework. This ensures that your audit trail captures not just your application's data handling, but also the infrastructure-level compliance provided by ThinkOn.

**Scaling Strategy:** Plan how your Canadian sovereignty features will scale as your user base grows. ThinkOn's infrastructure capabilities should inform your technical decisions, ensuring that your sovereignty features can handle production loads without compromising performance or compliance.

## Development Best Practices for Canadian Sovereignty

As you implement these features, keep several important principles in mind that will ensure your success and maintainability.

**Privacy by Design:** Build privacy protection into every component from the beginning, rather than adding it as an afterthought. This approach ensures that Canadian sovereignty features are robust and comprehensive.

**Auditability:** Every component should generate appropriate audit trails that demonstrate compliance with Canadian privacy law. Design your logging and monitoring to support compliance reporting from day one.

**Graceful Degradation:** Your Canadian sovereignty features should fail safely. If encryption services are unavailable, the system should refuse to process private data rather than falling back to unencrypted operation.

**Testing and Validation:** Develop comprehensive tests that validate not just functionality, but also compliance with Canadian privacy requirements. These tests should simulate real-world scenarios including privacy requests, compliance audits, and cross-border data access attempts.

This approach builds upon Gander's excellent foundation while adding the Canadian sovereignty features you need for Gander Social. The key is understanding and respecting the existing architecture while carefully extending it to meet Canadian legal and technical requirements.

Remember, data sovereignty is as much about operational procedures and governance as it is about technical implementation. This technical foundation supports those broader requirements by providing the necessary tools for compliance, audit, and secure data handling within Canadian jurisdiction.
